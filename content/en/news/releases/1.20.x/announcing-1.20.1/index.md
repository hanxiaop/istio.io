## Changes

- **Fixed** an issue where the webhook generated by `istioctl tag set` was unexpectedly being removed by the installer.
  ([Issue #47423](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47423))

- **Fixed** an issue where `istioctl tag list` command did not accept the `--output` flag.
  ([Issue #47696](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47696))

- **Fixed** an issue where custom injection of the `istio-proxy` container was not working on OpenShift, due to how
  OpenShift sets the pod's `SecurityContext.RunAs` field.

- **Fixed** an issue where `VirtualService` HTTP header present match did not work with `header-name: {}` set.
  ([Issue #47341](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47341))

- **Fixed** multi-cluster leader election not being able to prioritize local over remote leaders.
  ([Issue #47901](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47901))

- **Fixed** a memory leak when `hostNetwork` pods scaled up and down.
  ([Issue #47893](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47893))

- **Fixed** a memory leak when `WorkloadEntries` changed their IP address.
  ([Issue #47893](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47893))

- **Fixed** a memory leak when a `ServiceEntry` was removed.
  ([Issue #47893](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47893))

- **Improved** `istioctl bug-report` performance by reducing the amount of calls to the Kubernetes API. The included
  pod/node details in the report remain comprehensive but will be presented differently.

- **Removed** `--rps-limit` flag for `istioctl bug-report` and **added** `--rq-concurrency` flag.
  This change enables the bug reporter to limit request concurrency rather than the request rate to the Kubernetes API.
